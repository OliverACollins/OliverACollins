## Hi there 👋

My name is Oliver, and I am an undergraduate Psychology student, and current Placement Research Assistant, at the University of Sussex!

My academic interests include:
- Human perception (within psychology and cognitive and clinical neuroscience) 👁️
- Psychophysiology 🧠🫀
- Metascience and research methods 🔬

I am particularly interested in the development of software aiding research in psychophysiology, such as human-computer interfaces. For example, I have recently developed a Python package allowing one to [control music using respiration signals](https://github.com/OliverACollins/Respiration-Controlled-Music).

Outside of education, my interests include playing guitar 🎸, go-karting 🏎, and building LEGO 🧱
